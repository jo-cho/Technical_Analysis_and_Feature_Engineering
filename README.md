# Feature Engineering and Feature importance of Technical Indicators in Financial markets.

## Technical Indicators
- I studied over 80 technical indicators in five notebooks.
    - [1. Technical Indicators - Volume.ipynb](https://github.com/jo-cho/Technical_Analysis_and_Feature_Engineering/blob/main/1.%20Technical%20Indicators%20-%20Volume.ipynb)
    - [2. Technical Indicators - Volatility.ipynb](https://github.com/jo-cho/Technical_Analysis_and_Feature_Engineering/blob/main/2.%20Technical%20Indicators%20-%20Volatility.ipynb)
    - [3. Technical Indicators - Trend.ipynb](https://github.com/jo-cho/Technical_Analysis_and_Feature_Engineering/blob/main/3.%20Technical%20Indicators%20-%20Trend.ipynb)
    - [4. Technical Indicators - Momentum.ipynb](https://github.com/jo-cho/Technical_Analysis_and_Feature_Engineering/blob/main/4.%20Technical%20Indicators%20-%20Momentum.ipynb)
    - [5. Using technical indicators in Meta-labeling.ipynb](https://github.com/jo-cho/Technical_Analysis_and_Feature_Engineering/blob/main/5.%20Using%20technical%20indicators%20in%20Meta-labeling.ipynb)
- With some Tech. indicators (old version)
    - [TI Analysis](https://github.com/jo-cho/Technical_Indicators_analysis/blob/main/Tech.Indicators%20Analysis.ipynb)
- Is it better than simple market data?
    - [TI vs. Simple](https://github.com/jo-cho/Technical_Indicators_analysis/blob/main/Tech.Indicators%20vs.%20Simple.ipynb)

## Feature Importance
- Which one is important? with MDI
    - [Correlation with the PC (principle component) of highest MDI](https://github.com/jo-cho/Technical_Indicators_analysis/blob/main/ML%20PCA%20Feature%20Importance.ipynb)

## Feature Engineering
- Autoencoder
    - (https://github.com/jo-cho/trading-rules-using-machine-learning)
    - working on this

## Data
- Cryptos
- Stocks
- ... will be updated

## Used in the example
