class BaseTimeSeriesCrossValidator:
    """
    Abstract class for time series cross-validation.
    Time series cross-validation requires each sample has a prediction time pred_time, at which the features are used to
    predict the response, and an evaluation time eval_time, at which the response is known and the error can be
    computed. Importantly, it means that unlike in standard sklearn cross-validation, the samples X, response y,
    pred_times and eval_times must all be pandas dataframe/series having the same index. It is also assumed that the
    samples are time-ordered with respect to the prediction time (i.e. pred_times is non-decreasing).

class PurgedWalkForwardCV(BaseTimeSeriesCrossValidator):
    """
    Purged walk-forward cross-validation
    As described in Advances in financial machine learning, Marcos Lopez de Prado, 2018.
    The samples are decomposed into n_splits folds containing equal numbers of samples, without shuffling. In each cross
    validation round, n_test_splits contiguous folds are used as the test set, while the train set consists in between
    min_train_splits and max_train_splits immediately preceding folds.
    Each sample should be tagged with a prediction time pred_time and an evaluation time eval_time. The split is such
    that the intervals [pred_times, eval_times] associated to samples in the train and test set do not overlap. (The
    overlapping samples are dropped.)
    With split_by_times = True in the split method, it is also possible to split the samples in folds spanning equal
    time intervals (using the prediction time as a time tag), instead of folds containing equal numbers of samples.
    Parameters

    n_splits : int, default=10
